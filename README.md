# VORMaster3000
Redbird Data Parser for use with web based data interfaces of Redbird flight simulators.

This program scrapes the web data viewer interface for airspeed, heaidng, and altitude data to be graded in excel. This data is then 
output in CSV format for import into excel. 

Collection time will need to be edited in the future when different patterns are used.
